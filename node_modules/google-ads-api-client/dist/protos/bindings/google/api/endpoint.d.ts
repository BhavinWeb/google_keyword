/**
 * `Endpoint` describes a network endpoint of a service that serves a set of
 * APIs. It is commonly known as a service endpoint. A service may expose
 * any number of service endpoints, and all service endpoints share the same
 * service definition, such as quota limits and monitoring metrics.
 *
 * Example service configuration:
 *
 *     name: library-example.googleapis.com
 *     endpoints:
 *       # Below entry makes 'google.example.library.v1.Library'
 *       # API be served from endpoint address library-example.googleapis.com.
 *       # It also allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the backend, for
 *       # it to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
 *       # allowed to proceed.
 *     - name: library-example.googleapis.com
